# ConVen-NOMINATE
W-NOMINATE scores for Delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787

Delegate W-NOMINATE scores were originally computed  by Jac C. Heckelman and Keith Dougherty in "A Spatial Analysis of Delegate Voting at the Constitutional Convention" (2013) using the W-NOMINATE Program developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal (for more on W-NOMINATE, see The W-NOMINATE Program).   However, Heckelman and Dougherty do not provide replication code and NOMINATE is particular to implement.
