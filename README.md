W-NOMINATE scores for Delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787

Delegate W-NOMINATE scores were originally computed  by Jac C. Heckelman and Keith Dougherty in "A Spatial Analysis of Delegate Voting at the Constitutional Convention" (2013) using the W-NOMINATE Program developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal (for more on W-NOMINATE, see The W-NOMINATE Program).   However, Heckelman and Dougherty do not provide replication code and NOMINATE can be finicky.

"Convention_WNOMINATE.R" provides a complete walk through of how to implement W-NOMINATE for the Constitutional Convention delegate roll call data of data available in ICPSR study 33865.  This includes correctly transforming the roll call data, setting the NOMINATE anchor, and creating NOMINATE scores on various dimensions and with different delegates as anchors to verify the veracity of Convention NOMINATE scores.  This is also the code used to generate some of the results in my paper "Ideology and Participation at the Constitutional Convention of 1787."
